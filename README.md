### What I learned

This was the first time I attempted to create a responsive website. I did not follow a mobile first mindset when starting and oh boy did I pay it. 

I started the project like I would any old project and things went pretty smoothly at first. I set my main and footer divs and structured the website in what now I feel has become a typical workflow of "I know this" and "I'll Google that". Then, after I got the website looking the way I wanted, it hit me. How on earth I'm I suppose to make this thing responsive for mobile. My last few Frontend Mentor challenges didn't need me to create a responsive website so I did what I always do, Google the answer. It turned out that the solutions involved learning Flexbox and CSS Grid. 

After much Googling and tutorial watching I started to implement Flexbox. I coded here, adjusted there and after a while of tinkering I realized why having a "mobile first" mindset was a thing. It makes everything so much easier doint that way. Growing things into a larger canvas is easier than trying to shrink big things down into a smaller canvas. 

I used Flexbox in my past challenges but mostly for centering big things so when I had to figure out how to use it to position divs to get the look I was going for, I was stoked how great this little feature of CSS was.

CSS Grid, I didn't use it too much in this project, it litterally was only used for my container class but it took me down a rabit whole that I'm grateful I found. 

This project might not be the best show of what I learned given given that I didn't apply a "mobile-first" mindset when I started the project but, next one will definately have some of the best practices learned from my pal Google, Udemy and YouTube.

It will be very interesting, as I learn more and get better at this, to look back as some of the work I've done and see how much I've improved. I look forward to reflecring after I gotten better. 

### Continued development

Going forward, I'm going to maintain a "mobile first" mindset. I also intend to get a better grasp of Flexbox and CSS Grid as I continue on with my journey at Frontend Mentor.
