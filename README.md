## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

### Built with

- CSS
- HTML
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

This was the first time I attempted to create a responsive website. I did not follow a mobile first mindset when starting and did I pay for that decision. 

I started the project like I would any old project and things went pretty smoothly at first. I set my main and footer divs and structured the website in what now I feel has become a typical workflow of "I know this" and "I'll Google that". Then, after I got the website looking the way I wanted, it hit me. How on earth I'm I suppose to make this thing responsive for mobile. My last few FE Mentor challenges didn't need me to create a responsive website so I did what I always do, Google the answer. It turned out that the solutions involved learning Flexbox and CSS Grid. 

After much Googling and tutorial watching I started to implement a Flexbox. I coded here, adjusted there and after a while of tinkering I realized why having a "mobile first" mindset was a thing. It makes everything so much easier doint that way. Growing things into a larger canvas, easier than trying to shrink big things down into a smaller canvas. 

I used Flexbox in my past challenges but mostly for centering big things so when I had to figure out how to use it to position divs to get the look I was going for, I was stoked how great this little feature of CSS was.

CSS Grid, I didn't use it too much in this project, it litterally was only used for my container class but it took me down a rabit whole that I'm grateful I found. 



This project might not be the best show of what I learned given I didn't apply a "mobile-first" mindset when I started the project but next one will definately have some of the best practices learned from my pal Google, Udemy and YouTube.

It will be very interesting, as I learn more and get better at this, to look back as some of this work and see how much I've improved. 

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```
